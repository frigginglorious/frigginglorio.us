http://frigginglorio.us

Rebuilding my personal website, which is mostly vanilla PHP, and documenting the process!

### TODO:
1. ~~First and foremost: security. Hash DB passwords, parameterize queries (I made a DB backup before putting this on github)~~
2. flesh out CMS with options to ~~edit~~/delete posts
3. clean up filestructure
4. add ~~CRU~~D for CMS categories
5. Figure out how to handle deleting for categories. Don't want to orphan posts in DB. Should I just innactivate them, or delete entirely from DB? Are they visible from the admin panel at all?
5. Add some cool stuff with REACT
6. Add decent content!
