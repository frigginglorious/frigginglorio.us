Rebuilding my personal website, which is mostly vanilla PHP, and documenting the process!

### TODO:
1. First and foremost: security. Hash DB passwords, parameterize queries (I made a DB backup before putting this on github)
2. flesh out CMS with options to edit/delete posts
3. clean up filestructure
4. add CRUD for CMS categories
5. Add some cool stuff with REACT
6. Add decent content!
