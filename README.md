Rebuilding my personal website, which is mostly vanilla PHP, and documenting the process!

TODO:


#1 First and foremost: security. Hash DB passwords, parameterize queries (i made a DB backup before putting this on github)
#2 flesh out CMS with options to edit/delete posts
#3 clean up filestructure
#4 generalize CMS better so it could be reused.
#5 Add some cool stuff with REACT
#6 Add decent content!
