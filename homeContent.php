		I am currently seeking challenging, gainful employment. If you're interested in hiring a skilled, motivated, and all-around amazing individual like myself, you can view my official <a href="fil/DanielKraft_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a>, but I would rather you take a look at the passions projects available on this site: a <a href="?postID=33">labor of love in itself</a>.</p>
	<p>
		My dream job is <strong>Developer Evangelist</strong>: creatively building and demonstrating technology. The Job I'm currently seeking will require my passion for people as well as creative uses of open source technology; it will deliver new challenges every day, push my abilities to their furthest extent, and allow room to grow professionally.

		Though I currently dwell in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, USA, my primary residence will always be the internet.
